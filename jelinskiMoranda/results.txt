Estimated N: 249.21, Estimated phi: 0.0989
Actual N: 250, Actual phi: 0.1000
Random seed used: 1749434685
Fixed time for smooth reliability: 0.1

RELIABILITY EXPLANATION:
- Smooth curves use fixed time point - show theoretical decreasing failure rate
- Erratic curves use random intervals - show real-world variability
- Both are correct, but smooth curves show the underlying J-M model trend
